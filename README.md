# Integrated HR Management System

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of an **Integrated HR Management System** to streamline and automate key human resource functions, including **attendance, leaves, payroll, and branch management**. The system utilizes a **web-based interface** to interact with the backend, providing an efficient solution to reduce errors and improve HR workflows.

## Problem Statement

HR processes often suffer from inefficiencies and errors due to disjointed systems. Our solution aims to integrate attendance, leaves, payroll, and branch management into a unified system to enhance operational efficiency, reduce manual errors, and ensure real-time updates.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Database**: MySQL, ER Diagrams, DDL/DML
- **Web Technologies**: Python, JavaScript (Frontend)
- **Concurrency Management**: Transaction handling, Serializability
- **Optimization**: Query optimization after normalization, FD/MVD checks

## Features

- **Attendance Management**: Tracks employee attendance efficiently.
- **Leave Management**: Handles employee leave requests and approvals.
- **Payroll System**: Automates payroll calculations and ensures timely payments.
- **Branch Management**: Manages multiple branches and employee assignments.

### Finance Module (E-wallet)
- Ensures **concurrency handling** in financial transactions and guarantees **serializability** to avoid data inconsistencies.

### Database Optimization
- After **normalization**, we optimized database queries and implemented **integrity constraints** and **FD/MVD checks** to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## Web Interface

- Developed a **web-based interface** to allow users to interact with the backend system, making HR processes more intuitive and user-friendly.
- The interface reduces errors by automating tasks and providing a streamlined user experience.

## Conclusion

- The integrated system provides a cohesive and error-free HR management experience, with optimized performance and enhanced scalability.
- The **e-wallet** module ensures safe and reliable financial transaction management, improving overall efficiency.
